# Instructions for Merging Admin1.0 into Main Branch

Since we encountered authentication issues when trying to push directly from the local environment, here are the steps to merge the Admin1.0 branch into the main branch using GitHub's web interface:

## Option 1: Using GitHub's Web Interface

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/davidabdel/stagemateai
2. Click on the "Pull requests" tab
3. Click on the "Admin Dashboard Enhancements" pull request (#2)
4. Scroll down to see if there are any conflicts that need to be resolved
5. If there are conflicts, click on "Resolve conflicts" and manually fix them
6. Once conflicts are resolved (or if there are none), click on "Merge pull request"
7. Confirm the merge by clicking "Confirm merge"

## Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (if installed)

If you have GitHub CLI installed and authenticated, you can run:

```bash
gh pr merge 2 --merge
```

## Option 3: Force Push from Local (requires Git credentials)

If you want to set up Git credentials and push from your local environment:

1. Configure Git credentials:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

2. Set up a personal access token:
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
   - Generate a new token with repo scope
   - Use this token as your password when pushing

3. Push to main:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

## Verifying the Merge

After merging, verify that:

1. The main branch contains all the changes from Admin1.0
2. The admin dashboard shows the maintenance page
3. The API endpoints for credit management and contact form are working

## Next Steps

Once the merge is complete:

1. Continue developing the full admin dashboard functionality locally
2. Test thoroughly with real data
3. Deploy the completed version when ready
