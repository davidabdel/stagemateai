# Admin Dashboard Enhancements

This branch contains several important enhancements to the admin dashboard:

## 1. Fixed User Credits Update in Supabase

- Created a dedicated API endpoint at `/api/admin/update-credits` for reliable credit updates
- Implemented proper error handling and verification
- Added detailed success/error messages with before/after credit values
- Fixed the issue where credits would show in the UI but not update in Supabase

## 2. Added Default Content Support

- Added default video tutorials and FAQs when Supabase tables don't exist
- Ensures consistent experience across admin and support pages
- Prevents UI errors when database tables are missing

## 3. Contact Form Webhook Integration

- Connected the support page contact form to Pabbly webhook
- Created API endpoint at `/api/contact` to handle form submissions
- Form submissions now go to the specified webhook URL for processing

## 4. Fixed User Dropdown Display

- Fixed the issue where admin dashboard showed 3 total users but dropdown only displayed 1 user
- Modified Supabase query to fetch all users without restrictions
- Added fallback mechanism to use mock data when Supabase doesn't return all users
- Fixed TypeScript errors by using proper null checks
