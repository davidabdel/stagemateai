# üõ†Ô∏è Mobile App Troubleshooting Guide

This document outlines a step-by-step approach to diagnosing and resolving issues related to the app not working on mobile devices. Each step addresses a potential cause. Try **Step 1** first; if it does **not** resolve the issue, revert the change and proceed to **Step 2**, and so on.

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Content-Type Handling Differences

**Issue**  
Mobile browsers might handle `Content-Type` headers differently than desktop browsers. If your code is enforcing strict content-type validation, it may be incompatible with how mobile interprets or receives these headers.

**Suggested Fix**  
- Relax or modify the `Content-Type` validation logic for mobile requests.
- Log and inspect the actual content-type received on mobile devices to verify.

**If this does NOT work:**  
- Revert the content-type validation changes.
- Proceed to Step 2.

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Memory Limitations with `ArrayBuffer`

**Issue**  
Mobile devices may have tighter memory limits and can behave differently when allocating memory, especially with large `ArrayBuffer` operations. Even a small file size may trigger allocation failures on mobile.

**Suggested Fix**  
- Optimize memory usage when using `ArrayBuffer`.
- Try chunking the buffer or using streaming APIs.
- Add try-catch around buffer creation to detect and gracefully handle memory errors.

**If this does NOT work:**  
- Revert to the original buffer handling.
- Proceed to Step 3.

## ‚úÖ Step 3: User-Agent Detection and Server Responses

**Issue**  
Your code may send custom `User-Agent` headers or allow the browser‚Äôs default. Servers (e.g., CDNs or image hosts) sometimes respond differently based on the `User-Agent`, affecting behavior on mobile.

**Suggested Fix**  
- Compare mobile and desktop request headers and server responses.
- Test with a neutral or desktop-like `User-Agent` on mobile.
- Avoid overriding the `User-Agent` unless necessary.

**If this does NOT work:**  
- Revert any `User-Agent` changes.
- Proceed to Step 4.

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Browser API Implementation Differences

**Issue**  
Mobile browsers may not fully support or may behave differently with certain JavaScript APIs. For instance, the `toFile()` method from the OpenAI SDK might behave inconsistently.

**Suggested Fix**  
- Check for mobile compatibility for any newer APIs used.
- Polyfill or create fallback logic for mobile.
- Replace or mock the `toFile()` method with manual blob/file conversion if needed.

**If this does NOT work:**  
- Revert any SDK modifications or polyfills.
- Consider filing a bug with browser-specific details or reaching out to SDK support.

## üîÅ Continue This Cycle

Repeat this process, one step at a time, reverting and advancing until the issue is resolved.

Be sure to:
- Document each change and its result.
- Test across multiple mobile browsers (Safari, Chrome, etc.).
- Compare behaviors with desktop browsers.
